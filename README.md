Short Description / Purpose:

Sales Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report designed to help users explore and compare over 6000 sales across 4 sectors in USA. The dashboard focuses on sales based on monthly, and daily basis. It derives the basic glimpse like which category had more sales, and which category achieved significant profit and so on. The dashboard also focused sales forecasting to predict the sales trend for next 15 days at the end of the date mentioned in the dataset.

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
